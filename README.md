Through this project, we were able to get more practice with javaScript, and allow the user to work dynamically with the website


In the nav bar, pressing "Products" takes you back to the main page (index.html) and "About" takes you to the about us page (about.html, BONUS). Clicking "shop for cats" from the products page will take you to the cat category page (cats.html). The second product, "Cat Backpack" is clickable (catpack.html) and will take you to the product details page. The product details for the "Dog Backpack" (dogpack.html, BONUS) can be access through the "Recommended" section in the catpack page, or the "New Arrivals" section in the products page. Items can be added to both the cart and wishlist-- to be added to cart, the user must select color, size, quantity, but for wishlist, just quantity is required. In the shopping cart page, the total price is shown, and items can be removed.
