In the nav bar, pressing "Products" takes you back to the main page (index.html) and "About" takes you to the about us page (about.html, BONUS). Clicking "shop for cats" from the products page will take you to the cat category page (cats.html). The second product, "Cat Backpack" is clickable (catpack.html) and will take you to the product details page. The product details for the "Dog Backpack" (dogpack.html, BONUS) can be access through the "Recommended" section in the catpack page, or the "New Arrivals" section in the products page.
